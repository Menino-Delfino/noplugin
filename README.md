NoPlugin
================
NoPlugin is an extension for Chrome, Opera, and Firefox that allows you to play some plugin content in your browser without plugins. Most browsers are phasing out plugins, due to security concerns, so NoPlugin was created to maintain some compatibility with outdated sites.

NoPlugin searches webpages for embedded plugin code, and converts them to HTML5 players [if the file format is supported by your browser](https://github.com/corbindavenport/noplugin/wiki/Why-cant-NoPlugin-play-a-video%3F). If the file cannot be played in the browser, NoPlugin can download it for playback with the video/audio players installed on your computer.
