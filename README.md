NoPlugin
================
NoPlugin is an extension for Chrome, Opera, and Firefox that allows you to play some plugin content in your browser without plugins. All browsers have phrased out the use of web plugins, due to performance and security problems, so NoPlugin was created to maintain some compatibility with outdated sites.

NoPlugin searches webpages for embedded plugin objects, and converts them to HTML5 media objects. If the browser is unable to play the file natively, NoPlugin can still download it to your computer.
