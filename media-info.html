				<h2>Why cant NoPlugin play certain media files?</h2>
				<p>NoPlugin converts embedded plugin objects into standard HTML5 media player objects. The types of files that can be played using HTML5 depends on your browser and operating system.</p>
                <p>Most browsers can play <b>MP4</b>, <b>MP3</b>, <b>M4A</b>, and <b>WAV</b> files natively. Some <b>QuickTime (.qt, .mov)</b> files can also be played, if the files use compatible video and audio codecs (like H.264 for video and AAC for audio).</p>
                <p>If your browser cannot play a certain file, you can click the 'Download media file' button to open the file with a media player on your computer. If you're on a Chromebook that supports Android apps, you can click the 'Open with VLC for Android' button to stream the media using VLC Media Player for Android. If you don't have VLC installed, clicking the button will take you to the Play Store page.</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank">VLC Media Player</a> is the best option for opening downloaded media, since it can play just about every video and audio file in existence. You may need to <a href="http://cache-download.real.com/free/support/win/16/RealPlayer_eu.exe" target="_blank">download RealPlayer 16</a> to play <b>RealPlayer (.ram, .rmp, .rm)</b> media files.</p>
